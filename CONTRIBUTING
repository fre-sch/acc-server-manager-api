# Contribution guideline

## Preface

In case of discussions and arguments, consider the Zen of Python please. Note
that these are not ordered, they are of equal importance. They are perspectives
to consider when faced with problems and conflicts.

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### Typing

Keep usage of type annotations simple and to a minimum. Python isn't a static
type checked language, this project won't use a static type checker. Use type
annotations to document functions and methods, or add crucial non-obvious
information. Don't use types just to use types.

Constructing elaborate type hierarchies is not the focus of this project.

### PEP8

Use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with a maximum line length of 80
characters. Using `black` to format  **your** code is fine, but don't reformat
code you didn't have to touch. Unless it grossly violates PEP8.

## Branches and Pull-Requests

- Use git-flow with default settings.
- If you don't know what git-flow is, [read about it](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/).
- Install this or any other git-flow fork: https://github.com/nvie/gitflow
- Branch `master` is the stable and production-ready branch.
- Branch `develop` is "next-release", it merges features and bugfixes.
- Pull-Requests must always target `develop`.
- If you want to contribute a rewrite/refactor, please create a ticket to
  provide and discuss your reasoning, intentions and the (projected) benefits.
